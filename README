README for Perl extension WWW::Curl

The perl module WWW::Curl provides an interface to the cURL library "libcurl".
See http://curl.haxx.se/ for more information on cURL and libcurl.

This module requires libcurl and the corresponding headerfiles to be
installed. You then may install this module via the usual way
(for installation on Windows please see README.Win32):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The Makefile.PL script will try to use the 'curl-config' command to find
the correct headers and libcurl path. If curl.h can't be found,
either through curl-config or the internal list of guesses, you can specify
an explicit path when building the Makefile:

    perl Makefile.PL /home/foo/curl/include

If you want to specify which curl-config to use instead of the first in path 
set the environment variable CURL_CONFIG to point at the curl-config to use.

Minimum version requirements:

This module, starting from version 4 requires at least Perl 5.6 and libcurl 7.10.8.
These releases are more than 5 years old and they have multiple security vulnerabilities,
it is advised that you upgrade as soon as possible to a more recent, secure version.
Anything older than these versions of Perl and libcurl respectively are not supported.

Windows specific fixes and patches are welcome as testing is mainly focused on linux.

The module provides the same functionality, except as noted in the documentation, 
as libcurl provides to C programs. Please refer to the documentation of libcurl for the
general interface description and the WWW::Curl POD for the differences.
